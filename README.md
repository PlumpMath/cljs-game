A game about time travel

Some Next Possible Items:

* Add a creature and do some AI work.
* Composable way to create graphics.
* Add threejs objects into the renderable component, instead of doing the create and update function. Would be simpler.
* Fix entities api to use a hash-map for the components instead of a vector. Big rewrite but faster. Though it means
  there can only be one of each type of component. I think that's ok and the code already assumes that is the case.
* Graphics, shader and cool time travel animation. (probably best to do later)
* Keep hackin!
