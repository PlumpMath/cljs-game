A 3d game experiemnt

You can play it here [http://cljs-game.herokuapp.com/]

Was a second experiment in making a threejs game in clojurescript. I've mostly stopped working on it.

Could serve as an example for one way to set up a 3d game engine in threejs and clojurescript.

Also has the beginings of some precedural model generation ideas I've been thinking about.

Watch out for the antisun!
